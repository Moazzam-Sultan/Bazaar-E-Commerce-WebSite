![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1000x300?text=Bazaar+E-Commerce+Application)

🔗 **[Live Demo](https://bazaar-e-commerce-web-site.vercel.app/)** ---

## 📖 About The Project

As a Software Engineering student transitioning from WordPress to full-stack development, I built this project to master the core concepts of **React.js**. 

This application simulates a real-world shopping experience where users can browse products, filter categories, view detailed product pages, and manage a shopping cart state globally across the application.

### 🌟 Key Features
* **Dynamic Product Catalog:** Fetches product data and renders components dynamically.
* **Shopping Cart Logic:** Add items, remove items, and calculate total prices in real-time.
* **Single Page Application (SPA):** Smooth navigation between pages using **React Router** without page reloads.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop screens.
* **State Management:** Utilized to manage data flow effectively between components.

## 💡 What I Learned
Building this project helped solidify my understanding of:

1.  **React Hooks:** Mastering `useState` for UI updates and `useEffect` for handling side effects.
2.  **Component Architecture:** Breaking down the UI into reusable chunks (`ProductCard.js`, `Navbar.js`, `CartItem.js`).
3.  **Prop Drilling vs. Context:** Understanding how to pass data efficiently between parent and child components.
4.  **Array Methods:** Heavily using `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` to render lists and calculate cart totals.
